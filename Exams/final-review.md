# Topics Since Midterm

1. Strings

   - string.h library
   - strcpy
   - strcmp
   - sscanf
   - strlen (what does it do vs. sizeof)

2. Structures

   - declare a structure based on information it needs to store
   - accessing properties in a structure using `.`
   - passing a structure to a function
     - accessing properties when the structure is a copy (.)
     - accessing properties when the structure is an address (\*var_name || ->)
   - returning a structure
   - hierarchy in structures (structures in structures)

3. Dynamic Memory Allocation

   - advantages to using the heap
     - can create & free memory as needed
   - defining how much memory to reserve (sizeof)
   - malloc
   - calloc
   - realloc
   - free

4. Linked Lists

   - declaring a structure for a linked list
   - linking nodes together
   - passing a linked list to a function
   - accessing structure properties in a linked list node
   - identifying the end of a linked list (NULL)
   - inserting a new node
     - to the front
     - to the end
     - in the middle
   - implications of deleting a node

5. Misc.

   - Header files

7. Arrays
   - searching
   - sorting
   - 2D arrays
