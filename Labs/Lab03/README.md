# Lab 03

## Getting Started
This lab will require you to create two projects, one for each Part.  You will upload both to Pilot

Resources:
* [While Loop](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/cprogramming/c_while_loop.htm)
* [For Loop](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/cprogramming/c_for_loop.htm)
* [Formatting Output](https://www.codingunit.com/printf-format-specifiers-format-conversions-and-formatted-output)

## Part 1 - While Loops:
The name of this project / folder should be Lab03-Part1-LastName (where LastName is your last name)

Modify [Lab 02](../Lab02/README.md) so that it uses a while loop.  The while loop should have the program evaulate sets of averages as long as the user enters 'y' to run another set.  If the user enters 'n' the loop should break.

### Sample execution:
```
Welcome to the grade estimator.  
Please enter four grade values: 94 64 75 82    
Your average grade is 78.75 - a letter grade of C is expected  
Would you like to run the grade estimator again? (y/n): y
Please enter four grade values: 89 32 56 34   
Your average grade is 52.75 - a letter grade of F is expected
Would you like to run the grade estimator again? (y/n): y
Please enter four grade values: 89 72 86 92   
Your average grade is 84.75 - a letter grade of B is expected
Would you like to run the grade estimator again? (y/n): n
Goodbye!
```

### Part 1 Rubric:
* Creating while that continues as long as user input is 'y': 2 pts
* Terminating while loop if user input is 'n': 2 pts
* Good comments, logical variable naming, and code structure: 1 pts

## Part 2 - For loops & formatting output:
The name of this project / folder should be Lab03-Part2-LastName (where LastName is your last name)

If a moderately active person cuts their calorie intake by 500 calories a day, they can typically lose about  
4 pounds a month.  Write a program that lets the user enter their starting weight, then creates and displays  
a table showing what their expected weight will be at the end of each month for the next 6 months.  Provide an encouraging statement at the end with the total weight that will be lost.  You must keep a running total of weight  
lost over time for full credit.

### Sample execution:
```
Please enter you current weight: 220
At your current weight of 220 lbs, let's look at your numbers over the next 6 months:
Month		Weight
-----------------
1		216
2		212  
3		208
4		204
5		200
6		196

Wow, you could lose 24 lbs over the next 6 months!
```

### Part 2 Rubric:
* For loop that prints formatted output: 2 pts
* Using the foor loop to keep a running total: 1 pts
* Printing running total in output: 1 pts
* Good comments, logical variable naming, and code structure: 1 pts

## What to Submit
Download your repl projects for Parts 1 & 2 or navigate to the folder in your file explorer.  

Upload the zip files to the corresponding Pilot Dropbox. (Lab03-Part1-LastName.zip & Lab03-Part2-LastName.zip)
It would be preferred if the two parts were zipped together as one submission.  Submitting each separately is acceptable.

Make zip in Windows:
1. Choose the folder you'd like to zip.
2. Right-click the folder, point to Send to, and then click Compressed folder(zipped). 
3. A new zipped folder will appear 
 
Make zip in Mac & Linux:
1. Choose the folder you'd like to zip.
2. Ctrl + click the folder and click Compress. 
3. A new zipped folder will appear 

Upload your .zip file to Pilot.
