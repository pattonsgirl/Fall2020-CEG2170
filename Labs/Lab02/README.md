# Lab 02

The name of this project / folder should be Lab02-LastName (where LastName is your last name)

This link to [If-Else Statements in C](https://www.programiz.com/c-programming/c-if-else-statement) and [C Input Output](https://www.programiz.com/c-programming/c-input-output) are good resources for this lab.

## If-Else Statements

Write a program that requests 4 grades from the user, computes the average grade, then tells the user their average and corresponding letter grade.

For capturing input, you may either have the user enter all grades at once OR ask for grades one at a time - the sample run will show output for have the user enter all grades at once.

| Numeric Grade Scale        | Corresponding Letter Grade                       |
| ---------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| average >= 90              | A                                                |
| 80 >= average < 90         | B                                                |
| 70 >= average < 80         | C                                                |
| 60 >= average < 70         | D                                                |
| average < 60               | F                                                |

Sample Run:  
```
Welcome to the grade estimator.  
Please enter four grade values: 94 64 75 82  
Your average grade is 78.75 - a letter grade of C is expected
```

Rubric:
