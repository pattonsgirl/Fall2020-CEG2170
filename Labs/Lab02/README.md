# Lab 02

The name of this project / folder should be Lab01-LastName (where LastName is your last name)

This link to [If-Else Statements in C](https://www.programiz.com/c-programming/c-if-else-statement) is a good resource for this lab.

## Earthquake Charactarization - If-Else Statements

Write a program that determines the amount of damage projected based on an earthquake's Richter scale value.  Use a ladder style if-else statement to complete this lab.

| Richter Scale Number (n)        | Characterization                                 |
| --------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| n < 5.0                         | little or no damage                              |
| 5.0 <= n > 5.5                  | some damage                                      |
| 5.5 <= n > 6.5                  | serious damage: walls may crack or fall          |
| 6.5 <= n > 7.0                  | disaster: houses and buildings may collapse      |
| higher                          | catastophe: most building will be destroyed      |

Sample Run:  
`Welcome to the earthquake damage estimator.`  
`Please enter a Richter scale value: 6.3`  
`This earthquake will cause serious damage: walls may crack or fall`
